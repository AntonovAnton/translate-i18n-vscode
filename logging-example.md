# Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

VS Code extension now has comprehensive logging capabilities that provide both user-friendly error messages AND detailed technical logging for debugging.

## How It Works

### 1. User-Friendly Messages
Users still see clean, helpful error messages via `vscode.window.showErrorMessage()`:
- "Failed to translate: Insufficient balance. Please visit https://l10n.dev/#pricing to purchase more characters."
- "API Key migrated to secure storage for better security! üîê"

### 2. Detailed Technical Logging
Developers and support can access detailed logs in VS Code's Output panel:

**To view logs:**
1. Open VS Code's Output panel (View ‚Üí Output)
2. Select "Translate i18n JSON" from the dropdown

**Example log entries:**
```
[2024-01-15T10:30:45.234Z] API Key found in configuration, migrating to secure storage
[2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z] Starting translation to es
[2024-01-15T10:30:45.567Z] Translation completed successfully
```

**Error log entries:**
```
[2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z] ERROR: File saving failed
[2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z] ERROR: Context: handleTranslateCommand
[2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z] ERROR: Stack: Error: No valid project found in workspace
    at handleTranslateCommand (translationCommand.ts:45:15)
```

## What Gets Logged

### Translation Service
- ‚úÖ Language prediction requests and results
- ‚úÖ Translation API calls (start/success/error)
- ‚úÖ API error details with response codes
- ‚úÖ Finish reason warnings

### API Key Manager
- ‚úÖ API Key migration events
- ‚úÖ API Key clearing operations
- ‚úÖ New API Key storage events
- ‚úÖ User cancellations

### Translation Commands
- ‚úÖ Command execution start/end
- ‚úÖ Language selection events
- ‚úÖ Translation success with timing
- ‚úÖ Detailed error context with stack traces

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Clean, actionable error messages
2. **Support**: Detailed logs help diagnose user issues
3. **Development**: Stack traces and context for debugging
4. **Monitoring**: Track API usage and error patterns
5. **Security**: Sensitive data (API Keys) are not logged in detail

## Best Practices

- User messages focus on what the user should DO
- Logs include context, timestamps, and technical details
- Errors include stack traces when helpful
- Success operations are logged for audit trails
- API responses include status codes and error details

This dual approach ensures the extension is both user-friendly AND maintainable!
